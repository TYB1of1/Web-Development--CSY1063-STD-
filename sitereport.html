        <p>My experience on this module especially on learning HTML and CSS was overall enjoyable and a good experience as I haven't worked on neither of those things before so it was nice learning something new.
        </p>
        <p>The main colour of the page was a baby blue as I feel like it gave my portfolio a friendly and inviting look to it, and made the header a nice purple colour as i felt like it complimented the baby blue nicely and made the footer relly to give the page a good contrast and also makes it very visible 
        </p>
        <p>I kept the theme across all pages to give my portfolio a consistent look and more user friendly, as the user will not need to adjust to new colours each time they switch pages 
        </p>
        <p>On my home page I used and animated image of myself to give an idea to the viewers of what i look like. I then gave a brief description, on the right side of the image, of who I am and what all my different pages consist of and what information you find on them. I then put the navigation for the website across the top of the page just below the header, so it is easy to spot and navigate through the website, in the mobile version for the home page i created an hamburger icon to make the navigation side in for you to use and the image is at the top of the text to make it easier for everything to fit in the mobile stucture. 
        </p>
        <p>on my portfolio page I used the same lay out as the homepage in terms of the header and the navigation except that the header is on the left side of the screen to distinguish it from the home page. The main content of the portfolio page i put images of my past work followed my an short text of what the project was about and a bit about the company, and again colours where kept the same to help familiarity.
        The mobile version like the homepage is all made mobile friendly with the navigation getting controlled through an hamburger icon.  
        </p>
        <p>On my contacts page i tried to keep it as simplistic as possible as i wanted users of the website to find it easy to get in contact via facebook through the URL link, GitHub through the URL link and Snapchat also through a clickable URL link, not only that but we also have a textbox that when something gates typed into it and gets submitted through the button will get sent to our email.
        The mobile version of the contact page is like the homepage and the portfolio page as it is all made mobile friendly with the navigation getting controlled through an hamburger icon.  
        </p>
        <p>on my portfolio page I used the same lay out as the homepage in terms of the header and the navigation except that the header is on the left side of the screen to distinguish it from the home page. The main content of the portfolio page i put images of my past work followed my an short text of what the project was about and a bit about the company, and again colours where kept the same to help familiarity.
        <p>On my Work experience page i kept the same layout as the portfolio page with the header and the navigation and also the way the main content is set up with the image at the top and the context at the bottom, and again colours where kept the same to help familiarity.The mobile version like the all the other pages all made mobile friendly with the navigation getting controlled through an hamburger icon.
